  <h3 class="A02"> What is the difference between the ‘id' and ‘class' attributes of HTML elements?</h3>
  <p id="B01">Ans:</p>
  <b class="A03">The ‘id' attribute defines a unique identifier for an HTML element, while the ‘class' attribute defines
    a class for a group of elements. An ‘id' can only be used once on a page, while a ‘class' can be used multiple
    times.</b>

  <h3 class="A05"> What is the difference between link tag
    <link> and anchor tag <a>?
  </h3>
  <p id="B02">Ans:</p>
  <b class="A06">The
    <link> tag links external resources, such as CSS stylesheets, to an HTML document. The <a> tag creates links to
      other pages or resources within the same document.

  <h3>CSS</h3>
  <b id="B03">Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document
    written in a markup language such as HTML or XML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside
    HTML and JavaScript.</b>
    <br><br>
    <b id="B03">CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts. This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.</b>
