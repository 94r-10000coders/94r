<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
The Asgardian warrior continues his big-screen adventures in Thor: The Dark World as he battles to save Earth and all Nine Realms from a shadowy enemy that predates the universe itself. In the aftermath of Marvel's Thor and Marvel's The Avengers, Thor fights to restore order across the cosmos...but an ancient race led by the vengeful Malekith returns to plunge the universe back into darkness. Faced with an enemy that even Odin and Asgard cannot withstand, the God of Thunder must embark on his most perilous and personal journey yet, one that will reunite him with Jane Foster and force him to sacrifice everything to save us all. This junior novel includes eight pages of photos from the upcoming film!
