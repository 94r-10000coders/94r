<h2>Realization of Synchronous Binary Counter with Backward Carry Propagation</h2>
<p>The ripple carries chain in the traditional binary counter was replaced with a backward carry propagation. Backward carry propagation was used to accomplish both constant delay and binary sequence. It exploits the characteristics of a binary sequence that the more significant bits become high earlier than the less significant bits. This approach can be applied to achieve a constant-delay counter since the carry propagation is only determined by the least significant bit (LSB)
