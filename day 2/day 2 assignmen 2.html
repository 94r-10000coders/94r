Salaar is an upcoming Indian Telugu-language action thriller film written and directed by Prashanth Neel, and produced by Vijay Kiragandur. It stars Prabhas as the titular character,[6] along with Prithviraj Sukumaran, Shruti Haasan, Jagapathi Babu, Tinnu Anand, Easwari Rao, Sriya Reddy, and Ramachandra Raju.The film's shoot began on 29 January 2021 in the coal mines near the city of Godavarikhani, Telangana.[24] First schedule was completed by February 2021.[25] Second schedule of the film began in August 2021 in Hyderabad.[26][27]

About 30% of the shoot was completed by March 2022. Filming was halted due to the release of Prabhas' Radhe Shyam (2022) and Neel's K.G.F: Chapter 2 (2022) and was planned to be resumed in May.[28] However, Prabhas underwent a knee fracture in March during his vacation in Spain, which further delayed the shoot.[29][30] In June 2022, a new schedule began at Hyderabad's Ramoji Film City with Prabhas and Haasan joining the sets.[31] The team also shot a 20-minute long action sequence in the middle of the sea, spending about ₹10 crore on the scene.[32]

Makers of Salaar reportedly employed Dark Centric Theme (DCT) technology to shoot the film, making it the first Indian film to do so. As a result the film's lighting pattern and color palette would be darker in color
The film was announced in December 2020 with principal photography beginning in January 2021 near Godavarikhani, Telangana. The music is composed by Ravi Basrur, while the cinematography is done by Bhuvan Gowda.
