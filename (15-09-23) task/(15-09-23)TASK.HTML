        <h1 class="eng">Engineers' Day</h1>
        <p style="line-height: 30px;">National Engineers' Day, celebrated on <strong>September 15th</strong>, honours engineers for their vital role is shaping society. This date marks the birth of Mokshagundam Visvesvaraya, an outstanding Indian engineer. Engineers' Day recognizes their contributions to India's development through innovation and technology, The 2023 theme, 'Engineering for a sustainable Future,' highlights engineers' role in addressing global challenges.</p>

        <h1>Engineers’ Day 2023: Know why it is celebrated on September 15</h1>
       <div  style="line-height: 25px;">
        <p>In 1968, the government of India decided to honour Visvesvaraya for his numerous achievements in civil engineering by naming his birth anniversary on September 15 as the date to commemorate National Engineer's Day.</p>
        <p>Engineers’ Day is observed every year on September 15 across India to celebrate the birth anniversary of M Visvesvaraya and recognise the contributions made by him in the field of science and technology. Popularly known as M Visvesvaraya, his complete name is Mokshagundam Visvesvaraya. Engineer’s Day is also celebrated in Sri Lanka and Tanzania on September 15.</p>
        <p>M Visvesvaraya was born in the year 1861 in a Telugu family at Chikkaballapur located at a distance of around 60 km from Bengaluru, Karnataka. After completing his formal school education in his hometown, Visvesvaraya went to study BA at the University of Madras. However, he later switched and pursued a diploma in civil engineering at the College of Science in Pune. </p>

        <h2 style="background-color:gold;">The brilliance of Sir M Visvesvaraya</h2>
       <div class="img"> <img src="./m viavesvaraya.webp" width="420px" height="300px"/></div>
      </div>
      <div class="par"> <p>Visvesvaraya became an assistant engineer in 1885 at the Public Works Department, Bombay, in Bombay Presidency.</p>

           <p> In 1899, Visvesvaraya was invited to join the Indian Irrigation Commission where he implemented an intricate system of irrigation in the Deccan Plateau and designed and patented a system of automatic weir water floodgates that were first installed in 1903 at Khadakvasla Dam near Pune. These gates raised the storage level in the reservoir to the highest level likely to be attained without causing any damage to the dam. Based on the success of these gates, the same system was installed at Tigra Dam in Gwalior and later at the KRS Dam at Mysore, Karnataka. He later became the chief engineer of the Laxmi Talav Dam near Kolhapur.</p>
            
           <p> In around 1906/1907, the Government of British India sent Visvesvaraya to the British Colony of Aden (present-day Yemen), to study water supply and drainage systems. The project prepared by him was successfully implemented in Aden.</p>
            
          <p>  After opting for voluntary retirement in 1908, Visvesvaraya took a foreign tour to study industrialised nations. Then, for a short period, he worked for Nizam Osman Ali Khan. He was one of the chief engineers of the flood protection system for the city of Hyderabad who suggested flood relief measures for the city, which was under constant threat by the Musi river. He achieved celebrity status when he designed a flood protection system for the city. He was instrumental in developing a system to protect Visakhapatnam port from sea erosion. This dam created the biggest reservoir in Asia at the time of its construction.</p>
            
          <p> In November 1909, at the invitation of Dewan Sir V.P. Madhava Rao, Visvesvaraya joined as a chief engineer of Mysore State. He was the Chief Engineer of the KRS Dam at Mysore. He was also later the chairman of the board of engineers for the Tungabhadra Dam in Hospet, Karnataka.</p>

        On this Engineer's Day, I salute your technical prowess and problem-solving skills. Keep engineering the future!<br>
       <b> Why do we say Happy Engineers Day?</b><br>
        It is celebrated as tribute to the Indian engineer and Bharat Ratna Sir Mokshagundam Viswesvaraya (popularly known as Sir MV). This day is celebrated to respect Nasir al-Din al-Tusi, Iranian scientist.<br>
        <b>Who first invented engineering?</b><br>
            The earliest civil engineer known by name is Imhotep. As one of the officials of the Pharaoh, Djosèr, he probably designed and supervised the construction of the Pyramid of Djoser (the Step Pyramid) at Saqqara in Egypt around 2630–2611 BC. Ancient Greece developed machines in both civilian and military domains.
