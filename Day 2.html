<h1> Discription</h1>
<p>The charming leads are placed in a romance drama peppered with comedy and good music and the narrative packs in plenty of references to films of Mani Ratnam, and even Vijay and Samantha. Beneath that entertaining veneer is the conflict point of contrasting ideologies that can mar relationships. Shiva Nirvana takes a simplistic route to show that love can conquer differences. Some of the characters are strictly one note and the exploration of ideologies also remains at the surface level. </p>

<p> Miss Shetty Mr Polishetty, says Anushka, goes beyond looking at life as black and white. “Some of the decisions we make are driven by our grey areas, we touch upon such grey areas in the story.” The exposure this generation has, compared to that of their parents, says Anushka, pushes for earlier intellectual and emotional growth and this in turn lays bare certain grey areas. “We are all evolving and making different decisions, but the emotions that govern them remain the same.</p>

<h1> Discription</h1>
<p>A full house screamed throughout last night’s Times Square premiere of “Jailer,” a grisly and comedic action Indian thriller starring Rajinikanth, the marquee-topping, Tamil-speaking septuagenarian and self-advertised “Super Star.” Or at least, everybody alive in that auditorium seemed to be cheering for Rajinikanth.</p>

<img src=" https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/39/Jawan_film_poster.jpg" width="200" height="200"/>
<h1>Discription</h1>
<p>Jawan shares the story of an Indian individual who endured the harshest torture at the hands of a gang that brutally tormented many pitiful regular people while unable to understand the difference between even a little child. He made the decision not to leave anyone to cause harm to society after escaping from the gang. The remaining plot of this movie concerns how he locates the major antagonist and how he aims to take him out.</p>
