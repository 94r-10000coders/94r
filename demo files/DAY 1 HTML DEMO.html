<h1>What is HTML?</h1>

<p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is used to design web pages using a markup language. HTML is a combination of Hypertext and Markup language.
Hypertext defines the link between web pages. A markup language is used to define the text document within the tag which defines the structure of web pages.
This language is used to annotate text so that a machine can understand it and manipulate text accordingly.
